# Navigation & Training Ecosystem Guide

## 🔧 Navigation Fixes Completed

### Issue Fixed
The navigation bar in the dashboard was using static `<a href="#">` links instead of React Router navigation, making it impossible to navigate between pages.

### Solution Implemented
✅ **Replaced all navigation links with React Router `Link` components**
✅ **Added proper route highlighting based on current location**
✅ **Created placeholder pages for all navigation items**
✅ **Added new routes to the main App.jsx routing configuration**

### Navigation Routes Now Available:
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (existing)
- `/training` - **Enhanced Training Ecosystem** (newly implemented)
- `/tournaments` - Tournaments page (placeholder)
- `/community` - Community page (placeholder)
- `/profile` - User profile (existing)
- `/onboarding` - Onboarding flow (existing)
